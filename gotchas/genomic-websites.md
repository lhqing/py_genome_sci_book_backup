## Transcriptome annotation for human and mouse

For human and mouse, I recommend using GENCODE, which is a by-product of the ENCODE project and keep updating almost every month.

* [Here](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/) is up-to-date transcriptome annotation for human. 
* [Here](https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/) is up-to-data transcriptome annotation for mouse.

Once you downloaded a version from GENCODE \(e.g. M25 for mouse\), stick on it through out your whole project, this is an important start for making everything consistant.
